"""
ds_chat_hf_4bits_with_thinking_prompt.py

This module loads a local causal language model, generates responses based on user input,
and logs the thinking process along with the final answer.

The model is loaded with quantization settings to optimize memory usage and performance
(32 bits -> 8 bits).

The orchestration of the process is handled by the main function, and individual steps are
broken down into dedicated functions.

    """
    Load the model and tokenizer with 8-bit quantization configuration to optimize memory usage
    and inference performance.

    This function loads the model and tokenizer dynamically based on the environment variables.
    It also configures the model for 8-bit quantization, which reduces the memory footprint
    and speeds up inference, with the additional flexibility to control how much of the model
    is quantized via the 'llm_int8_threshold'.

    The quantization is performed using the `BitsAndBytesConfig`:
    - `load_in_8bit=True` ensures that the model weights are loaded in 8-bit precision (INT8),
        reducing the model's memory requirements.
    - `llm_int8_threshold=6.0` specifies a threshold for applying 8-bit quantization.
    Weights with magnitudes larger than this threshold will be quantized to 8-bit precision,
    while smaller weights may remain in higher precision to retain accuracy.

    The model is loaded in a way that allows it to automatically balance between CPU
    and GPU resources.

    Returns:
        Tuple: The tokenizer and model objects.

        Generate a response from the model based on the input prompt.

            - model (AutoModelForCausalLM): The model used for generating the response.

    .   #* About temp, top_k, top_p
        Temperature controls the randomness of the generated text, with higher values
        leading to more creative but less coherent output, and lower values resulting
        in more predictable, deterministic responses.

        Top-k limits token choices to the top k most likely options, reducing irrelevant
        text but potentially limiting creativity.

        Top-p (nucleus sampling) selects tokens dynamically until a cumulative probability
        threshold is met, balancing diversity and coherence, often used in combination
        with top-k.
